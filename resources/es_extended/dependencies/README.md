# RageUI

RageUI is the official replacement for NativeUI-Reloaded. This library allows you to create menus in GTA:O style. This project is open-source, so we rely on the community to help us upgrade/update RageUI. You can also work with us on the project to try to patch some issues.
If you want to contribute to this project, please use this guide: [Fork GitHub functionality](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). If someone copies our work without this functionality, we will temporarily delete the affected repository.

We invite you to respect the hard work that comes with providing this great and useful menu library!
